## **Strategy**
The idea behind the *Electric Vehicle Picker* is to create an application that can help brokers, advisors, or sales employees to find the best option for their customers. 
Based on the preferences regarding price, range, and type of car, a suitable match can be found and a recommendation can be made. 

The data given by the customer can be saved and used for further analysis. For example concerning the e-vehicle market, personal sales or marketing demographics.
